        <h2>this is our story</h2>
        <p>
          Siti Khadijah was born in 2010 out of a struggle familiar to many Muslim women – it was simply too hard to find comfortable, quality hijabs that made me feel confident. I couldn’t understand why such an important garment was so often
          treated as an afterthought. Clearly, I thought, we deserve better.
          <br> <br>
          I knew that creating the kind of hijabs we needed would mean taking matters into my own hands. Inspired by the Islamic tradition of ihsaan, doing everything with beauty and excellence, I founded Siti Khadijah with my husband and co-founder
          Nik Uzair and immediately got to work. We spent months searching for the perfect fabrics to create hijabs, rigorously testing them to ensure they were breathable, comfortable, washable, durable and beautiful – everything you should expect
          from your hijab.

          <p>We arranged for our designers to further their study of fashion design and invited senior designers to help us build our brand. Now, over a decade later, we have established a huge team of professional designers. Every one of our
            designers has his or her own unique sense of fashion; some focus on creating elegant, cute, athletic, sexy, trendy and all different styles. Our designers understand that you, as the customer, are looking for more than beautiful and
            fashionable clothes. You are pursuing a lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Once the design has been prototyped, the product officially enters into the production chain. At this point, advanced equipment and professional handiwork come into play. When we visit the factories, we sometimes lament the
            production-related inefficiencies. However, we are very pleased that through effective communication and cooperation, we are able to see shortened production cycles to release new products. We pay special attention to details like
            fastening and ironing, so we can present to you a flawless design.</p>

          <p>We carry out quality inspection of all of our products before officially introducing them to the market. We check for style, color, sizing, workmanship, and quality, etc. in order to eliminate any and all problems. We take measures to
            ensure that all of the cutting, sewing and ironing meet our quality requirements. There are ideal positions for each of these stages of production. Our workers follow guidebooks to ensure flawless appearance of the finalized product.</p>
